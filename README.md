## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was one of the first projects I did on my own, I know it's not a big deal, but at the time it helped me to consolidate the knowledge I had acquired in my first courses and having it around reminds me of the beginnings and how much I still have to learn.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This pages help me a lot back in the days and i still use it time to time, it has a lot of information in a very practical and visual way.
